          The admin page, also known as the dashboard or backend, is a private
          and secure section of a web application or website that is not
          directly accessible to end-users. Its primary role is to provide an
          interface for administrators and system managers to efficiently
          control, configure, and maintain the application or website.

            <strong className="font-semibold">Customization:</strong> Adapting

          In summary, the admin page is the backbone that enables the operation
          and management of a web application or website. Without it, it would
          be very difficult to keep content up-to-date, manage users, and ensure
          the stability and security of the system. It is a powerful tool that
          requires controlled access and responsible use to ensure the proper
          functioning of the platform.
